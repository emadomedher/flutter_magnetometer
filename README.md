## Supports Android only atm

To start using this add `import 'package:flutter_magnetometer/flutter_magnetometer.dart';`to your imports section.

Then you can simply listen to new events from the sensor via `FlutterMagnetometer.events.listen((MagnetometerData data) => doStuff(data));`.

An example app with a compass and raw sensor data in the UI can be found in ther `example` folder.
